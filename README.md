# easy_encrypt
used for secure generated keys links check not good for passwords, a benefit it will reduce the encryption size and encrypt the data itself instead of generate large security code only 4 codes and 10 numbers needed

best choice for encrypt SMS links (max len of code maybe 50) feel free to use large domains
